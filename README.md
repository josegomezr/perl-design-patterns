Design Patterns I find around internet and try to implement in Perl, with some
extra documentation for future me.

The namespace scheme is a bit convoluted for the sake of explicitness but it
follows the pattern of: `PDP::{PATTERN-IN-QUESTION}`.

## Design Patterns Available:

- [State Pattern](./docs/state/)
- [Singleton Pattern](./docs/singleton/)
